<h1> Intermediate Projects from 100 Days of Code

<h2> Day 15: Coffee Machine Project </h2>
A coffee machine that dispenses three drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

<h2> Day 16: Coffee Machine in OOP </h2>
Rebuilt the coffee machine using objected oriented programming. Angela provided all the classes and corrresponding documentation for building each object.

<h2> Day 17: Quiz Game </h2>
A game that quizzes you on random trivia, built with OOP. 

<h2> Day 18: The Hirst Painting </h2>
Learned how to read and use documentation by doing a series of challenges involving the Turtle graphics library. For the Hirst Painting project, I used the Colorgram package to extract colors from an image. Then, I used turtle and the colors I extracted to create a spot painting. 

<h2> Day 19: Turtle Race </h2>
Place a bet on one of six turtles (each a color of the rainbow) and watch them race! Each turtle moves at a randomly assigned speed so you may or may not get lucky. This project was built using the Turtle graphics library.

<h2> Day 20-21: The Snake Game </h2>
Move a snake using the arrow keys and try to avoid colliding with the walls while consuming food to gain points.

<h2> Day 22: Build Pong: The Famous Arcade Game </h2>
Two players each control a paddle, bouncing a ball back and forth across a table. If you miss the ball, the other player scores a point. 
 
<h2> Day 23: The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project </h2>
Just your classic turtle crossing game. There's an incredibly busy multi-line highway and one intrepid turtle who has to cross the road without getting hit by a car. This project tested my understanding of object oriented programming, especially creating classes and class inheritance.

<h2> Day 24: Mail Merge Project </h2>
Mail merging involves taking a list of names and inserting each name into a letter. This project also tested my understanding of file paths and directories.

<h2> Day 25: The U.S. States Game </h2>
This project involved learning to work with CSV data and the Pandas library. The U.S. States Game helps you learn all the states names by using a blank map of the US to guess the names of states.

<h2> Day 26: The NATO Alphabet Project </h2>
I learned how to use dictionary and list comprehensions to complete this project. This program spells any word you enter into the console using the NATO phonetic alphabet. Pretty handy when you're explaining to someone over the phone how to spell your name!

<h2> Day 27: Mile to Kilometers Converter Project </h2>
Today we dived into graphical user interfaces with Tkinter and learned more about function arguments in order to build a unit converter program using Tkinter.
