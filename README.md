<h1> Intermediate Projects from 100 Days of Code

<h2> Day 15: Coffee Machine Project </h2>
A coffee machine that dispenses three drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

<h2> Day 16: Coffee Machine in OOP </h2>
Rebuilt the coffee machine using objected oriented programming. Angela provided all the classes and corrresponding documentation for building each object.

<h2> Day 17: Quiz Game </h2>
A game that quizzes you on random trivia, built with OOP. 

<h2> Day 18: The Hirst Painting </h2>
Learned how to read and use documentation by doing a series of challenges involving the Turtle graphics library. For the Hirst Painting project, I used the Colorgram package to extract colors from an image. Then, I used turtle and the colors I extracted to create a spot painting. 

<h2> Day 19: Turtle Race </h2>
Place a bet on one of six turtles (each a color of the rainbow) and watch them race! Each turtle moves at a randomly assigned speed so you may or may not get lucky. This project was built using the Turtle graphics library.

<h2> Day 20-21: The Snake Game </h2>
Move a snake using the arrow keys and try to avoid colliding with the walls while consuming food to gain points.
