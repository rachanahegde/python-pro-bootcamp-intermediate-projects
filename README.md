<h1> Intermediate Projects from 100 Days of Code

<h2> Day 15: Coffee Machine Project </h2>
A coffee machine that dispenses three drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

<h2> Day 16: Coffee Machine in OOP </h2>
Rebuilt the coffee machine using objected oriented programming. Angela provided all the classes and corrresponding documentation for building each object.

<h2> Day 17: Quiz Game </h2>
A game that quizzes you on random trivia, built with OOP. 

<h2> Day 18: The Hirst Painting </h2>
Learned how to read and use documentation by doing a series of challenges involving the Turtle graphics library. For the Hirst Painting project, I used the Colorgram package to extract colors from an image. Then, I used turtle and the colors I extracted to create a spot painting. 

<h2> Day 19: Turtle Race </h2>
Place a bet on one of six turtles (each a color of the rainbow) and watch them race! Each turtle moves at a randomly assigned speed so you may or may not get lucky. This project was built using the Turtle graphics library.

<h2> Day 20-21: The Snake Game </h2>
Move a snake using the arrow keys and try to avoid colliding with the walls while consuming food to gain points.

<h2> Day 22: Build Pong: The Famous Arcade Game </h2>
Two players each control a paddle, bouncing a ball back and forth across a table. If you miss the ball, the other player scores a point. 
 
<h2> Day 23: The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project </h2>
Just your classic turtle crossing game. There's an incredibly busy multi-line highway and one intrepid turtle who has to cross the road without getting hit by a car. This project tested my understanding of object oriented programming, especially creating classes and class inheritance.

<h2> Day 24: Mail Merge Project </h2>
Mail merging involves taking a list of names and inserting each name into a letter. This project also tested my understanding of file paths and directories.

<h2> Day 25: The U.S. States Game </h2>
This project involved learning to work with CSV data and the Pandas library. The U.S. States Game involves guessing the names of states on a map of the United States.
